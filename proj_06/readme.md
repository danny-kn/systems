# Count Signals

In this exercise, I implement a simple C program that handles UNIX signals using custom signal handlers. The program counts the number of `SIGINT` signals received and exits gracefully upon receiving a `SIGQUIT` signal.

## Implementation Details

- **Signal Handlers**: The program defines two signal handlers:
  - `sigint_handler`: Increments a counter each time a `SIGINT` signal (usually generated by pressing `ctrl + c`) is received and prints the current count.
  - `sigquit_handler`: Prints the final count of `SIGINT` signals received and exits the program when a `SIGQUIT` signal (usually generated by pressing `ctrl + \`) is received.

- **Signal Registration**: The `signal()` function is used to associate the signal handlers with their respective signals.

- **Infinite Loop**: The program runs an infinite loop to keep the process alive, allowing it to continuously listen for signals.

## References

You may refer to the documentation for the `signal()` function using the `man signal` command.
