# Count Signals

In this exercise, I implement a simple C program which handles UNIX signals using custom signal handlers. The program counts the number of `SIGINT` signals received and terminates gracefully upon receiving a `SIGQUIT` signal.

## Implementation Details

- __Signal Handlers:__ The program defines two signal handlers:
  - `sigint_handler`: Increments a counter each time a `SIGINT` signal (usually generated by pressing ctrl + c) is received and outputs the current count to standard output (1).
  - `sigquit_handler`: Outputs the final count of `SIGINT` signals received to standard output (1) and terminates the program when a `SIGQUIT` signal (usually generated by pressing ctrl + \) is received.

- __Signal Registration:__ The `signal()` function is used to associate the signal handlers with their respective signals.

- __Infinite Loop:__ The program executes an infinite loop to keep the process alive, allowing it to continuously listen for signals.

## References

You may refer to the documentation for the `signal()` function using the `man signal` command.
