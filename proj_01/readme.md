# Process Creation

In this exercise, I implement a simple C program which creates a child process using the `fork()` system call. In the child process, I retrieve the process ID using the `getpid()` system call and output a message to standard output (1) indicating its value.

You may refer to the documentation for the `fork()` and `getpid()` system calls using the `man fork` and `man getpid` commands, respectively.
